# Pixelbomber
A program to nuke pixelflut servers

This client is largely inspired by [pixelpwnr](https://github.com/timvisee/pixelpwnr), although I made heavy modifications to decrease the bottlenecks.

# Features
- Concurrent writing pipes
- Animated images with consecutive images
- Control over render sizes and offsett
- Faster than [pixelpwnr](https://github.com/timvisee/pixelpwnr) (in my case by more than a Factor of 8)
- Linux, Windows and MacOS
- Same cli as pixelpwnr
